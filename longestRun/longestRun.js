/**
* Longest Run
* Write a function that, given a string, finds the longest run of identical characters and returns an array containing the start and end indices of that run. 
* If there are two runs of equal length, return the first one. Return [0,0] for no runs.
* Examples: 
* Input: "abbbcc"	Output: [ 1, 3 ]
* Input: "mississippi" Output: [ 2, 3 ]
* Input: "abcdefgh" Output: [ 0, 0 ]
* Input: "aabbbcccc" Output: [ 5, 4 ]
